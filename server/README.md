# Riffy's Server

## Overview

The 'server' directory contains the backend code for the Riffy application. This backend is responsible for handling data processing, API calls, routing, and other server-side functionalities.

## Directory Structure

- **api/**: Contains the application programming interface (API) logic, defining how the server responds to requests for data and services.
- **config/**: Contains configuration files, including settings for databases, third-party services, or other backend configurations.
- **node_modules/**: Stores the Node.js modules (dependencies) installed for the project. These modules are used by the application's server-side JavaScript.
- **router/**: Holds the routing logic for the application, defining the paths and endpoints that the server responds to.

## Key Files

- **.env**: A configuration file for environment variables. Used to store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other configuration details securely.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in Git, typically including logs, system files, and the `node_modules` directory.
- **app.js**: The main application file for the server. This is where the server is set up and connected to routes, databases, and other services.
- **package-lock.json** & **package.json**: These files keep track of the exact version of each package that is installed, ensuring consistency across installations.
- **recommend.py**: Our Python script which is the recommendation system.
