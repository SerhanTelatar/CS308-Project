# Riffy's Web Frontend

## Overview

The 'web' directory contains the frontend code for the Riffy application. It focuses on providing a user-friendly interface and engaging user experience.

## Contents

- **index.html**: The main login page for the application. It features a user login form with fields for username and password, as well as an option to log in using Spotify credentials. The design is modern, utilizing inline CSS for styling and the Poppins font for a clean aesthetic.

- **register.html**: Handles user registration. It includes a signup form with fields for full name, username, email, and password, maintaining a consistent design with `index.html`. Also provides a link to the login page for existing users.

- **register.js**: Currently, this file is a placeholder for future JavaScript code.
